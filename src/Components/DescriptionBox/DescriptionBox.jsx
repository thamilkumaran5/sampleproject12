            The ecommerce site features excellent copy, really good images, 
            and a natural flow for potential buyers. Plus, everything is 
            optimized for conversion rates â€” for example, notice the 
            navigation bar: each link is to a commercial page; the navigation to 
            non-commercial pages like the contact or about page is placed 
            in the footer.
